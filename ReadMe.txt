ReadMe for Source Code for the book "Workflow in the 2007 Microsoft Office System" by David Mann.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code is broken out by chapter.  As only chapters 5 through 9 include any significant amount of code, only those are included.

I did not include the full set of project files for most of these (only the windows application from Chapter 8) as that just makes more fluff to wade through.  The source files included here cover all of the interesting bits.  

If you have any questions or problems, please feel free to ask at my website: http://www.kcdholdings.com.  I will also post any notices about the code or the book in general there.  The latest source code will be made available at the apress website http://www.apress.com.

Thanks.

Dave
